🚀 Astronaut Task Management System
Welcome to the Astronaut Task Management System! This console-based application is designed to efficiently manage tasks for astronauts during their missions. It provides features such as task creation, scheduling, conflict detection, and reporting.

🎯 Features
•	Task Creation: Create and manage tasks with specific deadlines and descriptions.
•	Task Scheduling: Schedule tasks with accurate start and end times.
•	Conflict Detection: Automatically detect and alert conflicts between tasks.
•	Observer Pattern: Implement observers to monitor task changes and conflicts.
•	Logging: Log actions performed within the application for audit purposes.
•	Task Status Tracking: View completed and pending tasks.
•	User Interaction: Console-based interaction for task management.

🛠️ Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Design Patterns: Singleton Pattern, Observer Pattern, Factory Pattern
•	Logging: Custom Logger
•	Version Control: Git

📋 Prerequisites
